# Sambahang Rizal

Established by the late Atty. Basilio Aromin in Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija in 1918

## Aims

Honor Rizal who was appointed by Bathala to redeem his race and people  and
who, Christ-like, offered up his life in oblation to save mankind.

## Beliefs

- The sect believes that Rizal is the "son of Bathala" in the same way that Jesus
Christ is the "Son of God." 
- Make use of the doctrines and teachings of Rizal through his novels, *El
Filibusterismo* and *Noli Me Tangere* as their "bible."


## Sacraments and Rituals

The sacraments are similar to those of the Catholic Church.

1. Baptism 
    -  the prospective member was baptized in "the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost" 
2. Confirmation
    - performed by the "lalawigan guru" (preacheer of the province), consisted
    in the members' promise to uphold the beliefs of the Sambahang Rizal.
3. Matrimony 
    - similar to the Catholic Church
4. Last Rites of the Dead
    - asks Bathala that "the dead merit heaven through the merits of Dr. Rizal"
