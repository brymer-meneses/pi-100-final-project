# Modern Impact

The Religious movements that venerate Rizal provide an insight on  how
individuals and communities can reinterpret historical figures like Rizal to
fulfill spiritual, cultural, or emotional needs.  

Max Weber, a German sociologist, popularized the term Charismatic Authority. 
Charismatic authority is power legitimized on the basis of a leader's
exceptional personal qualities, or the demonstration of extraordinary insight
and accomplishment, which inspire loyalty and obedience from follower. [^1]

Weber argued that in times of social crisis, people are more likely to turn to
charismatic leaders who they believe posses extraordinary qualities.

This can explain the rise of populist leaders from Pres. Bongbong Marcos and
Donald Trump and how, during periods of perceived social crisis or instability, 
populations may gravitate toward leaders who project an image of exceptional
ability or destinity--even when their actual policies or actions may not
serve public interests.

The emergence and persistence of Rizalist cults reveals a deeper pattern in
Filipino society's response to collective trauma and upheaval. These religious
movements initially emerged during a period of profound colonial oppression and
social transformation, when communities sought not just spiritual comfort but
also a sense of Filipino identity and empowerment. This historical pattern
becomes particularly relevant when examining contemporary Philippine society,
where the intergenerational trauma of colonialism, martial law, and ongoing
political instability continues to influence how communities respond to
charismatic figures. 

Even Bongbong Marcos Sr. had a cult that worshipped him:

Just as Rizalist cult members found solace and meaning by
transforming Rizal into a messianic figure, modern Filipinos may similarly seek
out strong leadership figures during times of crisis – whether economic
uncertainty, political instability, or social upheaval. This helps explain why,
despite the historical lessons of martial law, significant portions of the
population have embraced political dynasties and strongman figures who promise
stability and national redemption. The psychological dynamics that drove the
formation of Rizalist cults – the need for security, identity, and hope during
times of social trauma – continue to shape Philippine political behavior and
social movements today
