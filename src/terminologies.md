# What is a Religious Movement?


## Cult

Cults refer to a religious group, often living together, whose beliefs are
considered extreme or strange by many people[^1]. Cults usually have the
following characteristics: 

1. a charismatic leader who exercises total control
2. an apocalyptic vision
3. isolation from society
4. an emphasis on a transcendent spiritual experience
5. rigid rules governing group members’ behavior; and
6. the exploitation of members, including sexually and financially. [^2]

An example of a cult is The People's Temple which was led by Jim Jones. In
1978, Jones orchestrated a tragic event in Jonestown, Guyana, where he
convinced over 900 of his followers (including children) to drink poisoned
beverages in a murder-mass suicide. [^3]

Now scholars prefer the term New Religious Movements (NRMs) over cults due to
the negative connotation behind the term.

## New Religious Movement

New Religious Movements refer to new religious groups that have arisen
worldwide over the past centuries. They can be described as ‘countercultural’,
especially to the mainstream Western religions. [^4]

## Sect 

Sects refer to a religious group that has separated from a larger religion and
is considered to have extreme or unusual beliefs or customs. [^5]

An example of this is the Jehovah's Witnesses, which is a group that originated
in the late 19th century with distinctive beliefs that separate them from
mainstream Christian denominations, such as their rejection of the Trinity and
refusal to participate in certain social practices like voting or celebrating
birthdays [^6]. This distinction and their inherent influence from Christianity
makes this movement a sect.

## Denomination

A denomination is a subgroup within a religion that operates under a common
name, tradition, and identity. [^7] An example of this is Roman Catholicism,
which is a subgroup of Christianity, the most prevalent religion in the entire
world [^8]. A denomination is typically larger and more influential than a sect.
